NucleosUserBundle
=================

The Symfony Security component provides a flexible security framework that
allows you to load users from configuration, a database, or anywhere else
you can imagine. The NucleosUserBundle builds on top of this to make it quick
and easy to store users in a database, as well as functionality for reset password.

So, if you need to persist and fetch the users in your system to and from
a database, then you're in the right place.
