The NucleosUserBundle is a fork of [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/) which adds a lightweight support for a database-backed user system in symfony.

There are some major changes and refactorings if you want to migrate from FOS:

- It does not provide any advanced features like profile management or registration
- Swift mailer was dropped in favor of symfony mailer
- Couch DB support was removed
- Only symfony 5.4 / 6.x support
- There are only two *optional* dependencies: **doctrine/orm** and **doctrine/mongodb-odm**

Features included:

- Users can be stored via Doctrine ORM or MongoDB ODM
- Password reset support
